# Paseo across the fleet

[Paseo](https://paseo.sh) ([github.com/getpaseo/paseo](https://github.com/getpaseo/paseo), Apache-2.0) is an
agentic development environment: a daemon runs coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, OpenCode, Pi and
more, each in its own worktree) and desktop, web, Android/iOS and CLI clients connect to it. Installed
2026-10-18 at djbclark's request on every machine of the fleet. Decisions (djbclark, 2026-10-18):

1. One daemon per host, all on port **7263** (upstream default 6767), bound to loopback and published on the
   tailnet with `tailscale serve --https=7263`. Never `tailscale funnel`, never a public port.
2. **No daemon password and no relay** (app.paseo.sh): the tailnet is the boundary, as for BB
   ([bb-vps-primary.md](bb-vps-primary.md)). Paseo runs commands for anyone who reaches it.
3. Linux builds happen in Forgejo CI, never on a host: [forgejo.mit.edu/djbclark/paseo-nix](https://forgejo.mit.edu/djbclark/paseo-nix)
   packs the npm release into a hash-pinned tarball and carries the NixOS module (`services.paseo`).
4. Voice mode and dictation are off on the servers (`speech.enable = false`): on, the daemon downloads about
   200 MB of speech models at startup. The Mac app keeps them.

## Hosts

| Host | Daemon | Runs as | URL (tailnet only) | Config |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mac | Paseo.app (`brew install --cask paseo`) starts and owns it; LaunchAgent `com.djbclark.paseo-desktop` opens the app hidden at login and `keepRunningAfterQuit` keeps the daemon up after quitting (djbclark, 2026-10-18) | djbclark | https://mac.greyhound-sidemirror.ts.net:7263 | `roles/paseo_desktop` (`just paseo-desktop-apply`): `~/.paseo/config.json` keys, the serve and the LaunchAgent |
| vps-primary | `services.paseo` (systemd `paseo.service`) | `bb`, sharing BB's agent logins in `/var/lib/bb`; state `/var/lib/bb/.paseo` | https://vps-primary.greyhound-sidemirror.ts.net:7263 | `nixos/vps-primary/configuration.nix`; BB and Paseo share `agents.slice` (MemoryMax 3G) |
| get | `services.paseo` in the image | djbclark; state `~/.paseo` on `/persist` | https://get.greyhound-sidemirror.ts.net:7263 | `~/src/get` `nixos/paseo.nix`; the TSI port shim is preloaded; get's Tailscale shields are down for this (get `docs/runbook.md` 8.4) |

Clients: the Mac app adds the other two as hosts (Settings, Add host, Direct connection, `<name>.greyhound-sidemirror.ts.net`,
port 7263, SSL on); the Android app on the stayturgid phones the same way over Tailscale; any tailnet browser
opens the URLs above (the bundled web UI); the CLI takes `--host <name>.greyhound-sidemirror.ts.net:7263`
(the local daemon needs no `--host`).

Status 2026-10-18: all three daemons answer `/api/health` and the web UI over the tailnet (vps-primary at
site-djbclark f919386, get at image `ci-eb12788`, Mac app 0.11.4). Android `sh.paseo` 0.11.4 (stayturgid
`bootstrap_apks`, `just deploy-apks`) is on s24 and t2e; hd8 and p7a were off the tailnet and get it on their
next `deploy-apks`.

## Skills

Paseo's six agent skills are vendored in djbclark-ade (`skills/paseo*`, `skills/paseo/UPSTREAM.md`) and linked
into every TUI; `paseo-advisor`, `paseo-committee` and `paseo-handoff` fire only on explicit Paseo requests, so
the plain "handoff" and "second opinion" stay with the `handoff` skill and `acp-run`.

## Upgrading

1. Bump `pins.env` and relock `bundle/` in paseo-nix, push: the `build` workflow publishes a tarball and prints
   `PIN paseo <url> <hash>`; put that in `pkgs/pins.json` and push.
2. Build the checks on the runner: bb-build's `nix-build` workflow with `repo=https://forgejo.mit.edu/djbclark/paseo-nix.git`.
3. Update the consumers on the runner too (`update=paseo-nix`, which prints the new `flake.lock`): vps-primary
   (`dir=nixos`, then promote, [nixos-in-git.md](nixos-in-git.md)) and get (its `paseo-nix` input is pinned by `rev`;
   deploy with `scripts/deploy`). Deploy only the pushed branch head (`~/CLAUDE.md` 36: rebuilds are shared).
4. The Mac app updates itself (or `brew upgrade --cask paseo`). Keep the daemons on one version: the apps talk
   to all three.
